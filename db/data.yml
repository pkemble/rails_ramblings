    - new year's eve
    - Bright eyed tourist bewildered with confusion<br />Talking about impossible
      train routes to give the illusion<br />That you're a local that you live here
      just like me<br />And You can't believe you're stuck underground on the t<br
      />The car jolts through its dirty grease hole<br />Burrowing under boston like
      an obsolete green mole.<br />Shuddering into arlington station I long to get
      off<br />But on the platform a throng of tourists oh enough is enough.<br />They're
      talking of this city and how with it they are in love<br />But they greet me,
      a local, with a cross eyed blind shove.<br />Pushed back in the train I am,
      "excuse me please!!"<br />I realize I am in control as they only are up to my
      knees<br />Wading through festive children who for this is outer space<br />Happy
      new years kids! Tears stream on painted glittered face<br />Free from the trolley
      adjusting gloves on my wrists<br />Words muttered under a weary scarf, "mother
      fucking tourists..."

    - virginia beach proper<br /><br />staring out at the sea, my 4 year old niece
      and my elderly parents all in the distance, i thought of her laugh, i thought
      of her mind, i thought of the way she says the right things that no one else
      would think of. i thought of her as if my eyes opened, staring at the sun, the
      dawn, realizing with each wave on the shadowed sand, i was falling in love with
      her.<br /><br />surrounded by beautiful teenage girls basking in the late summer's
      last breath, laughing, looking at fitted out teenage boys trying to get that
      early autumn lay. a couple bobs in the waves, hugging kissing laughing. i clutch
      my nieces hand, she reaches over and strokes my balding head. she asks if she
      can go out further in the water. she responds to my 'no' with an equally terse
      'why?' because you're not old enough. besides, your mom would kill me.<br /><br
      />later still<br /><br />please please please release me from this. i long to
      sleep in my own bed. i long to be with my friends. i long to be at my local.
      i love you. i have fallen in love with you, friend. this afternoon surrounded
      by virginia teenage heat, i have fallen in love with you.

    - in the bar a few nights ago i turned back to eva and i said, 'sometimes i wonder
      if other people can see and hear you too'. a guardian angel in my life, a life
      that at times i recognize as being one that i shouldn't have right now, if it
      had not been for her unlimited kindness and compassion. when things are at their
      bleakest, when i have to fight back tears, madness and anxiety, it is her being,
      her voice which keeps me from fading completely from consciousness by my own
      hand. she is patient, she is lovely, she transcends all other people in my life
      as someone who sees beyond regular interaction. she is without context, which
      is not needed when i am with her. she knows what i am thinking at all times,
      a look at me in the bar, across from seven or eight people, she shakes her head,
      mouthing a 'no'. she knows i am thinking inside about becky, hurting myself.
      she is the best medication anyone could ask for. when i am alone at home, on
      the verge of an anxiety attack, further sinking into an abyss, tortured by memories
      of jane, of becky, of happier times wasted, i get a text message from her. she
      says 'smile'. while at work i am having trouble concentrating, biting back tears,
      trying to remain professional, i get a message from her that somewhere in the
      world wherever she is, she loves and cares about me. i really wonder if sometimes
      other people can see or hear her too. eva is trully a reason to believe that
      there is a higher power out there looking after us, sending us angels.

    - an isolationist
    - this is not an easy task which is laid out before me. to stop searching without,
      to stop seeking the external, but to lay a seed inside and allow it to grow
      through only my actions, and only my forward and global thinking. these dark
      thoughts, thoughts of ruining new relationships of my ex, thoughts of murder
      and suicide must be stricken from this journey. <br /><br />the dull roar and
      unending lightening strikes of adrenaline through my stomach has now given way
      to it's former occupant, depression. i miss things. i long after things. i miss
      the comfort, although in retrospect i must remember that it was not comfort
      at all. comfort i have found in the fleeting moments of positive thinking. they
      happen once every two days or so and catch me off guard. it's been 30 years,
      but i must found out what the fuck i am doing here. i have to be above the bullshit
      of my exes. i have to be above the drama, and the pain that these situations
      have caused. soon enough she will wise up, and realize that i am making her
      unhappy and she will cut me off from her world. i anticipate this sting 10-fold.
      i have been through months upon months of depression, unhappiness, fear and
      emotional isolation. all because of a night in amsterdam. when do i stop being
      punished for all this?

    - healing your heart is a mother of a bitch. wandering through memories and negative
      feelings, trying to re-wire the synapses that she tore apart can only be marked
      by the constant need for outside attention and distraction. alcohol gives us
      neither, but lubricates that process of sliding ever deeper into agony, a caustic
      abyss of wondering, tormenting yourself over every last molecule of your surroundings
      with her lovely face, the face that will no longer gaze on you longlingly, but
      instead will hapr on strange men's stomachs, ever emasculating you into deeper
      anger, loathesome self hatred, and the feeling that your stomach will explode
      in a hail of vomit all over the morning paper, all over the crossword puzzle
      that you wish would distract you from the separation anxiety, the addiction
      to the way she used to say she loved you. it's all shit, isn't it? we can only
      persevere. we can only overcome. we can only live on another day.

    - in utter abject misery i have lived the last 4 days. i worry what is happening
      to my body. i worry so much about everything. she, jane, toys so awfully with
      my heart, which in turn takes it out on my sanity. this utter heartbreak is
      more than i can bear. i never want to feel this badly again. never do i want
      to lose love again. never do i want to feel the soft touch of deception. the
      sting of rejection. i hate this. my mind is an absolute warzone and i worry
      about my synaptical health. i must look at things objectively. i cannot lose
      sight of being happy. i cannot lose sight on perspective. i will overcome this
      pain as i have every other time. i will overcome this too. life is not over.
      be good. be reasonable. don't give in to fears.for fuck's sake stay on top of
      it all and don't give in. don't follow down mental ambushes. keep it light.
      don't think too hard about it. i will overcome. for the sake of my life, for
      the sake of staying alive, i will overcome this pain.

    - "'that's just the thing' said the sneaker to the toes. 'it's what holds us together,
      the fabric between us,' said the sneakers to the toes. 'everyday you work me
      over, kicking me relentlessly while i envelope and protect you. day in, day
      out, you work me over completely. with socks a shroud over your dead feet, like
      funeral clothe, relentless pounding of the toes. never ending, permanent distress,
      pounding, pounding, pounding. and when the day comes, and it will, when i am
      old and worn to bits, there is no gold, no reward, no sunset or goal, just tossed
      aside in trash and left to rot in bins and holes. you get a new pair to fill
      your needs, leaving me to be lonely till the day when i am recognizable no more.'...said
      the sneakers to the toes.<br /><br />i cannot stand being around people that
      talk to me, yet being in the presence of kind people as ins the case here usually,
      i would rather not talk, but write. i like crowds so long as i am not noticed
      or or involved. (you must be crazy to be reading this). <br /><br />in gusts
      and gales these hateful winds blow back and forth, forcing me in and shutting
      myself out. oh dear bog, it's miserable living here on the outskirts of life,
      looking in through the window from which i jumped out, looking and praying for
      a way even further out. a drunken mess one night, a blubbery baby the next.
      to no end this haze envelopes, no more dutch girls to steer my heart in ways
      of err. far loneliness past, in hollow existance i am leaving myself to dogs
      of indecision, they knaw, but not know what to knaw on next, yet forever eating
      away at me as a whole. disgusting, vile, and autonamous, i, who doesn't know
      where he's going, and cannot remember where he's been."

    - "-PJ Ryans<br /><br />there are so many awful things about beautiful women.

      or those in [premeditated] disarray<br />molested and disheveled so beautifully
      by winter hats on the train.<br />i stare. <br />i cannot look away. <br />they
      don't look, not even a glance, and my mind faints in pain. <br />all productive
      thoughts cease and turn to the very singularity that cannot be ignored for another
      therapy session<br />that it kills your spirit that you cannot be good enough
      the be with them<br />never just right in their so specific idea of the perfect
      man.<br />you are a square peg to their unattainable and ode lauding hole. <br
      />but the most depressing part is when they notice you<br />a glance<br />a
      notification<br />perhaps even a vague, distant and forced smile.<br />that's
      when reality sets in<br />reality that cannot go unspoken for another therapy
      session<br />the very thought of being with them. <br />making love to them<br
      />waking up next to them<br />meeting all their insipid friends and robotic,
      brain-dead parents<br />having this thing that you need in your life like nothing
      else<br />berate you<br />and tell you in exacting ways how you don't live up
      <br />to standards you know nothing of<br />having fight after fight after fight
      over something thats insignificance can only be further diminished by the fact
      that in 80 years none of it will mean a thing.<br />two rotting corpses an infinite
      dimensional distance away from each other. <br />it's enough to give your stoney
      blank expression<br />the one saved specifically for public transportation <br
      />a jolt into an expression<br />even a sneer or worse. <br />but then it's
      all over. <br />those eyes<br />those legs<br />those hips hidden beneath a
      thick jacket<br />those beautiful heartbreaking eyes<br />that hair you pine
      for<br />to let on pillows that will only ever exist in imagination<br />gets
      up<br />floats to the door<br />the skirts<br />the ever present bag<br />and
      walks out of the car<br />left or right<br />she goes <br />with not one look<br
      />with not one instance of acknowledgment <br />that you ever graced her visage
      with the adoration and disgust that will exude from your pen and fester in your
      mind the whole time you sit at this blessed bar<br />drowning over and over
      and over again."

    - A conglomeration of bach playing. From my youth, ah the memories of angry adolescence,
      stern harpsichord muddlings. The pain of imagining her not in rapture with me.
      The rejection, the utter lack of responsibility in every facet of life. The
      mistakes that were made:<br /><br /><br />"come one, come all! it's an evening
      of the half-drunk should-have-been butchering the classics! from beethoven to
      chopin, from liszt to debussy! see him falter and stumble his way through the
      old favourites that once poured from his fingers the music which once made niaive
      schoolgirls cry with empathy, now make you cry with embarrassment! tickets aren't
      limited, and there's plenty of seats to fill, always an empty house ready to
      accomodate anyone willing to endure his interesting interpretations of what
      used to be talent, but now is empty rememberance, not even a shadow of the music
      that filled concert halls, but now a tattering on cheap instrument, and the
      gutteral noises of swill infecting his throat.a horrible time to be had by all,
      experiencing the groans between the tankering of awful, wrong notes, a clanging
      of meaningless phrases and jolted melodies. now the stinking, bleates of his
      no good plastic imitation ivory goddess, hardly, but a whore of musical instrument.
      it is no good alcohol, and useless nostalgia that makes him 'play'. only a former
      idea of what could have been, what should have been, the art in him that has
      now been replaced by cold, heartless servers, and hot polluting internal combusting
      contraptions. the talent has been lost, never to return. the motivation to slave
      away filled by a drudging familiarity that is the female posession. the love
      that has been lost to age, bitterness, and a loss of hope in those things that
      were taught not as fairy tales in his youth but as a goal to be attained."<br
      /><br />but were they mistakes that add to the beauty of learning the notes?
      I play them even worse now.

      look of discontent and mild disgust and aversion. It's the same look I give

    - Fucking weird. Here I hope will follow a documentation of some of the weird
      things that have been happenning to me in this cold town in the past 7 days.
      Last Wednesday I went out to Our House with Nora and her roommate ricardo. He
      was cool, and is interested in being in my riot boy band. I think the idea might
      work out. So this chick approaches us, and asks for a cigarette. She’s tanya,
      and she’s out o work, and all upset that she has $17 dollars left to her name.
      So I sympathise having been in the same situation, and give her 2. since she’s
      bitter, frustrated and kind of punk looking, I offer her to sing some stuff
      that I would write for her. She doesn’t sing, but leaves me a number anyway,
      and an e-mail address. Later on, I’m coming back from the bathroom, and she
      invites me over to her table where she’s with a friend, amanda. Amanda’s frigin’
      hot, but has a boyfriend, so that’s that, however tanya giving me signals, and
      I say what the hell. So it turns out she’s only 20, but her fake id says she’s
      29. good enough. We decide to go to the rest of mod night at the common ground
      around midnight. The bouncers don’t buy her fake id, so we have to go to the
      kells, the allston meatmarket, where they get hit on extensively by just about
      every sad, pathetic dateless jock there. I’m ready to go, because this tanya
      chick is provoking all of it, but she insists that I stay. I guess I probably
      shouldn’t have, since this weirdness has gone on long enough, and well, this
      just can’t turn out to be good a few weeks down the road. We end up back at
      tanya and amanda’s place, and amanda decided to go to bed. Well, one thing leads
      to another, and tanya and I end up sleeping together. I get home at 6:30, bright
      and early with only an hour and a half of sleep under my belt. Work sucked that
      day. That afternoon I call her, and she comes back over.we have sex again. This
      is looking odd, and we agree to be friends with benefits, because I’m just newly
      digging this single thing. Yes, for once, things are looking up. So Thursday
      night Amy, Collins, rob, jenny, and I go to harper’s ferry to see lovewhip,
      something I’ve been meaning to do for a while. Well, I’m fucking tired as shit,
      and dancing doesn’t seem to be helping, but lovewhip is like ska, so what the
      hell? 1.5 hours of sleep, dancing, and here comes the beers! By 12:30 or so,
      buck dewey comes on, and only amy and I are left. We decide to go over to the
      common ground for 80’s love night. When we get there, we are greeted by eighties
      rockers with arm band, leather, leather, and attitude! It’s rough there that
      night, but amy and I are tired as shit, and still wanna have fun, so we dance
      it up, with more and more beer. By the time the mosh pit comes around, we decide
      enough! It’s 1:45 or so, and I’m pooped. I slept well. Friday night rolls around,
      and after some much enjoyable $6.75 pitchers of micheloeb at the sillhouette
      lounge with my sister and brother-in-law, I end up meeting up with tanya at
      her friend chris’ house. They’re all so friekin’ hip, and trendy it hurts. They’re
      all sitting around thinking it’s funny as shit that as trendy and art school
      as they are, they still love christine aguilera and britney spears. “can you
      believe it? Oh my god!” pl-fucking-ease! So tanya and I leave, and get back
      to my house for inevitable. she goes to the bathroom, and pees, THEN tells me
      I’m out of toilet paper, and there’s none under the sink. Shit! It’s raining,
      I’m drunk again, and store 24 Is open down the end of the block. So I run down
      there to get some more TP, calling people to tell then how I should have gotten
      her to use a fucking coffee filter, and be done with it. Well, score some TP,
      and we’re in business. After she gets back home Saturday morning, I went to
      natick for greg’s rainy barbecue. I meet this chick named MC and she gets all
      flirty for about 5 minutes, and gets me to talk about going down on girls for
      a few minutes, before turning totally off again. Fucking girls. What is it?
      Provocation, then depletion of interest. Fuck it. Then around 10 I head over
      to a house party on farrington in allston. It’s emily’s graduation party, and
      I met a bunch of really cool people there. At one point my friend jeremy say,
      “hey pete, when you’re done down here, come upstairs. There’s another party
      up there.” Oh yeah! So I go upstairs a few minutes later, and there’s jeremy
      with two chicks, valerie and allison. Valerie thinks she’s betty fucking page,
      and allison is completely wasted on oxy-contin. Allison says, “are you staying
      around, ‘cause the coke will be here soon.” What!? Jesus christ. I turn it down
      flat, and she says she’ll have sex with me if I do some coke with her. I still
      turn her down, and she says that she wants to meet someone to have a life, and
      babies with. I turn her down laughing, and she starts to try to get all serious
      with me, she gets real close, and says, “what will it take to get you to get
      high with me, while she starts kind of going for my crotch. Alright, I know
      I’m kind of an idiot, but please, I’m not that desparate. I turn her down again,
      and she starts to leave saying she wants to find someone to have life, sex,
      coke and babies with. Jesus I was laughing so hard. Later on I saw her all over
      every other guy in the party, asking them the same thing. Apparantly, (jeremy
      told me earlier) that she thought that she had sex with me before, and that
      she was convinced that I was a filmographer, but she just couldn’t remember
      when she had sex with me. Nice girl. Must be like a hot-dog in a bucket. the
      rest of the night, valerie is making eyes at me, but as soon as I saw the digital
      camera pictures of her blowing coke, I though, hmmm….nah. so the night ended
      with me on the porch, smiths on the radio, and a really cool bunch of people
      hanging out. Sunday was weird too. It was father’s day, and my father came down
      to visit us, and spent the day with us. At one point I came back home to find
      16 bottles of liquor, some unopened, sitting ontop of the trash, along with
      about $40 worth of unopened food in a plastic bag. I was psyched! The lesbians
      in number 8 were moving out, and didn’t want to pack all of it, so they said,
      sure go ahead and take it. Yeah! Fully stocked wet bar in allston, ma.! The
      story continues on Tuesday night when I had nora, ricardo, collins, amanda and
      tanya over, and they sampled some of my sweet sweet alcohol collection. We all
      got trashed, had a great time, and after they all left, tanya stayed, and oh
      boy, bring on the dirt! She was well-nigh drunk, and I was pretty gone, so we
      end up screwing, after I begged for condoms from jenny. So I pull out afterwards,
      and crap!!!!!! No condom. Shit. I tell her to go into the bathroom, fish it
      out, and get in the bathtub, and wash it out. Wash all that shit out. She starts
      freaking out, screaming, oh crap, oh crap, I can’t get pregnant! I’m only 20!
      While I’m going jesus fucking hell, woman get a grip! She’s in the shower, and
      I’m like, wash it out! She says no, you do it. Oh fer cryin’ out crap! So I’m
      in the shower, digging with my fingers in her for god knows what, trying to
      keep my cool, drunk, worried, and alone in my apartment with this newly found-out
      psycho. She starts trying to make out with me while I’m fishing out the left
      over penis product, and goddam! I’m trying to do my job here! So later we decide
      to go to planned parenthood early next morning. Now I’m trying to get some sleep
      – it’s 3:40 in the morning, and I have to be up at 7, get to pp, then to work
      by 8:30. shit, now she’s all, oh my god, I’m going to be pregnant, then you
      have to marry me, and live with me forever! Fucking shit! How the fuck do I
      end up like this! I know how – I’m a fucking moron. That’s how. at this point,
      i'm thinking that maybe i should have treated jessie a little better. So then
      she starts with, do you like me? I like you a lot, and I like you more everyday.
      Jesus, like I need this shit now! I need fucking sleep, so I can get this chick
      the morning after pill, get to work, present to sales, and do my job. Well,
      she finally falls asleep, after this whole, ‘our first fight crap’ and the next
      morning, I take her to pp, (the goddam jesus – anti – abortion fuckers were
      there,) and she won’t get an appointment until 10. anyway, I go to work, (on
      the way out the jesus fuckers tried to get me to rethink tanya’s eminent abortion.
      I looked right one of them, and said, “get the fuck away from me, asshole!”)
      I’m freaking out, and later that day it turns out she’s alright. Now how the
      hell am I going to get out of this? I prolly won’t see her till Friday, so I’m
      good till then. Man, what a goddam week it’s been.

    - it's not easy defining who you are, but i think i have a litmus test, or at
      least a milestone to show that you are on your way. if you seriously consider
      leaving everything behind (responsibly that is) to live in a place that you
      will hate (that would be backwoods florida) and not allow it to define you,
      or at least try like hell to maintain individuality. a few years ago i never
      would have left boston. i never would have thought that i would leave behind
      the club nights, my so called indie lifestyle, the bands, the music, and the
      bars that made me who i am. as i got a ride back from the airport the driver
      started humming along with central florida's cheesy status quo radio stations
      (this has actually happened twice so far) from the spin doctors (shudder) to
      whatever other bullshit that FM has clogging up our national airspace system.
      with silvery haired men in khaki shorts and collared golf t-shirts driving shiny
      vans and dying palm trees under the development of capital gains (cookie cutter
      houses, hotels, fast food bullshit and whatever else comprises the american
      dream,) a few years ago i would run scared back to the safety of my boston hovel
      asking myself who i'd become while rocking back and forth listening to new order
      or something.<br /><br />but these things do not and would not define me. that's
      just that. is this because i now have a strong post-disthymia character? is
      this because i'm 32 going on 33? have the years of alcohol permanently emblazened
      a sense of what once was 'i'm the coolest guy in the bar' mentality and now
      tranfered it to my everyday life? am i just psyched that i'd have the basis
      for flying planes the rest of my life? perhaps it's all these things...thank
      god it's at least one of them.

    - "'the big man ale' noted on a post taped to the mirror. i am not a big man.
      i am a small man, if you can even call me one. floating down powder house boulevard
      to make it home to a small animal who loves me, who is happy to see me home
      is solace. but there is so much in my heart that is imprisoned in it's dysthemic
      barrier. to be surrounded by people yet feel lonely. to be sought after yet
      feel confused and awkward. to make the decision of whether to buy groceries
      or to commit suicide to frivolously is a reality that you wouldn't know. i wish
      for the happiness and the lightness that i once felt, but now know that it is
      too late. it is too late to feel much of anything. the vitriol and spit that
      accumulates on my face vomited out by those from the past, both real and imagined
      is what tarnishes my progress into what i hope i can be. i am surrounded by
      those who love me, but i feel nothing for. i only feel for my memories and the
      sadness that surrounds them. i am dysthimia, i am depression, i am what has
      dragged me down to this state of destitute. alone i am pushed into it. they
      never told us that it would be like this. they never told us that life would
      entail disaster and consequence. they only told us that we were special, that
      we would be something someday. i made it to something filled with nothing. it
      is not right for a man of 31 to be writing like he is 13."

    - the current state of my heart is confusing and terrible. i know that deep down
      i do love claire as soul mates, as two hearts fitting like pieces molded to
      each other. yet, i have a carnal desire to sleep with any other woman i can.
      yet, that life which i led this past summer leads to more than just sex. it
      always ends up being more complicated. this constant pull between love and lust
      is a battle never won, just fought in endless bloody battle again and again
      and again.

    - this thanksgiving is not like the others. i am alone as usual, but this time
      there is no wonderful girl to arrive back at home, bringing broccoli casserole
      and a tofu dinner that is unmatched. this thanksgiving i went to the homeless
      shelter to wash dishes, my heart in the right place, but mind not. i wonder
      with ever deepening sadness and remorse why it is that things have to be so
      hard for me when i try my best to do my best. i have offers of love, but i do
      not want them. i have offers of companionship, but i do not take them because
      i am more comfortable alone wallowing in the hell that i single handedly created
      than forcing myself to renew an emotion that still rests firmly planted on her.
      i try to think of others that are also alone and dealt a worse hand in life,
      and to take solace that all is not lost in my own, but it does me no help. i
      am still at the core a selfish person. i do not know how to change this. in
      my selfishness i long for her, i yearn in the fantasy that she might come in
      through the door, back from her parent's, or where ever she went that led to
      a fight over me not being there. i long for her arms to hold me again, to make
      me feel loved and secure. i do not want the arms of strangers anymore. i do
      not want to let anyone else in to my heart. her being has taken up steady residence
      in it, and she does not leave. as much as i will it, she will not leave my heart.
      the biggest mistake of my life, and i have to live with it for the rest of my
      days. a year has almost passed since i have pushed her away with my hasty actions
      of betrayal and disloyalty, one third the amount of time that she was in my
      life altogether, and it burns as if it was yesterday that she has left. the
      silence is torture. the hole left in my life where she used to bring light is
      a dark abyss of hunger given in to starvation for the smell of her forehead,
      the touch of her hair. life is now bleak and the only passion that remains is
      the sensation of her absence. it burns so darkly and stings so dully. i would
      give anything to have her back, but in a soul so seasonless these days, i wonder
      what it is i have left to offer.

    - i remember a time in light airy kitchens, the back porch hugging the life out
      of us, our sweet cat dividing rain between battleship nights. a hard movie to
      watch, your tears still bitter to me, in memory which is all that i have left
      at this point. your helping happiness thundering over me to flatten all hopes
      of reuniting when i need you the most to hold me to have me to bring me the
      joy i miss. i do not want, i do not pretend, i do not have a choice but to live

      and deeper the salt from stinging my eyes. i regret all of it.

    - i was walking between convenience stores this morning in search of non-latex
      condoms at the demand of a girl minutes prior when i started deciding what the
      opening lines of this entry would be. the circus started on friday night when
      the englishman, his girl and i went to allston to the britpop night. i started
      getting into it with the weasel's friend whom i am also friendly with, about
      how he stole the archaeologist from  me and how my bitterness was justified.
      he played it off as nothing, and this filled me with some minor rage. i needed
      to head out for a cigarette to diffuse the conversation, so i put my beer down
      next to a rather attractive girl, and asked if she could watch that for me.
      she gave me a face, and said that she'd do her best. i detected sarcasm. outside
      i cooled off, did some cbt and i was ok for the most part. who needed that whore,
      anyway? he did me a favour. they'll end soon enough anyway. on my way back in
      i picked up my beer, and started joking around with the girl, the way that becky
      and i uesd to. it was really nice. that day i had written becky off, and almost
      immediately it seemed her sense of humour was being replaced. i was floored
      by her personality. it seemed so right on at that moment. i could let myself
      go which was nice. i asked how old she was expecting the usual 23-25 year old
      shit. she said guess. i thought i'd at least compliment her and i said 21-22?
      then she said a beautiful thing, "twenty-nine". the words rolled out washing
      me over with hope, hope that there was hope and hope that though she may not
      be it, there is someone out there that is not 24 or 25. i told her to tell me
      again as if i didn't hear...."t w e n t y   n i n e . . ." she said. i was elated.
      we spent the remainder of the evening talking, joking dancing. man, she was
      sweet. i tried to teach her how not to dance like a hippy or a lesbian, the
      two dances she had mastered apparently. she is from seatlle. she bought me a
      drink without hesitation. she made fun of me. i was glad to come out. the englishman
      and his girl were getting in a fight, and he was on his way out with her. i
      said i'd stay. at the end of the night i shared a cab with the hippy and her
      friend. we dropped her friend off near harvard. i asked to use her can, but
      she didn't want to wake her kid up. wow. people my own age. it was a novelty.
      the hippy and i made it back to central square, and we had to pee pretty badly.
      we ducked behind a bar called the field and peed behind a dumpster and a car.
      it was the same alley where once becky and i had fooled around. and it wasn't
      alleyway fooling around, it was bedroom fooling around. the hippy and i were
      walking out of the alleyway, almost to the road. it was 3am. everything was
      shut, and the streets pretty empty. now or never i thought. i grabbed and planted
      one on her. she loved it. we made out for a while. i walked her back to her
      bike on mass ave. we made out a while more. she told me it was a boy's bike
      that she was riding. i said, 'oh yeah?' as she rode away. she turned over her
      shoulder and said 'yeah, it was my ex-husband's' and she rode off down a side
      street. i took a cab back home wondering what the hell had just happened. <br
      /><br />the following morning i got a message that she wanted to meet up for
      coffee. i agreed, and headed down to davis to meet her. i saw her walking down
      the street and followed to catch up. by the time i caught up to her, i had forgotten
      her name, and didn't want to tap her on the shoulder. she walked into another
      store, so i tapped, hoping for the best. she was startled, and then we both
      looked up at the sign above the door. it was planned parenthood. we laughed,
      she said she needed to get an abortion, and she'd be out in 5. i went to the
      bank, and said i'd meet her. we spent the afternoon together, we walked to porter
      to ride the escalator. we went to harvard and i got some camping supplies. we
      went to shays and sat outside drinking beers and talking. her mother had committed
      suicide that winter. she had been married for 6 months after 8 years of being
      together. he left her, and headed back to seattle. her sister has breast implants.
      we walked back to her's and made love on her bed. she had lots of strange tattoos.
      she has a dog and two cats. worn out, i went home, called up some friends to
      make plans for the evening. i started getting really depressed. i went to meet
      my brother at the bar where the hippy and i peed the night before. i went up
      to the local to meet up with the englishman. he was talking to a girl, and introduced
      me. she had a wonderful laugh. she was a socialist. we all got drunk together,
      and my roomate was there too. we headed back to our place after the bar closed,
      and brought the socialist and her roomate, the collector along for the ride
      as well. we had some booze i think. we sat and drank and played music. the socialist
      was on fire. three guys, and she knew she was the center of attention, and boy
      oh boy did she act on it. i hate that shit. after sometime, she decided to take
      her shirt off. she was sucking up all the attention. i swear i really hate that
      shit. later my roomate, visibly frustrated, went to bed. i felt bad. the socialist's
      roomate headed out as well. the socialist and i fooled around until the sun
      came up. she was demanding. my jaw hurt. i half slept, and woke up sweating.
      it was hot. she was lovely. petite, soft. i didn't feel guilty at all. i didn't
      care anymore. i was aware that i was giving up. nothing mattered. it was horrible.
      she woke up and i offered breakfast. i headed out to get it, and came back with
      it. she ate messily, and left half of it on my nightstand. she kept going on
      about the revolution. she kept calling mundane things "counter-revolutionary".  i
      told her socialism was dumb. all politics are dumb. you replace one system that
      fails on fulfilling everyone's values for another that fails on fulfilling everyone's
      stomachs. she started to fool around with herself, but said she needed a nap.
      i went out to the living room and 5 minutes later she came out to say that i
      needed to go get a certain brand of condom, because she needed to get fucked.
      i was indifferent. i didn't care. my head was somewhere else, and my heart,
      no more. i said, sure, and went out to find these condoms. i never found them
      i came back and blamed it on capitalism. i threw my european passport on her
      stomach. we fooled around a little more, exchanged numbers, and she went home.
      i just don't care about it anymore.

    - i can't remember what happened on thursday. although i just remembered, i left
      the comfort of my local to go down to this swank lounge in central for the englishman's
      friend's going away party. i was afraid i'd run into the english girl there,
      the one who had such a good and special time with me, she decided to run and
      not call anymore. the musician did the same thing about a week or two later.
      i'm cursed with this shit. anyway, the english girl wasn't there, so i had a
      beer, and went out for a cigarette. a girl who was with a guy kept giving me
      eyes, and it was creeping me out. we exchanged a few words, but then i split
      for the safety of my local. back there my new roomate was having beers, getting
      to know the regulars. thankfully the artist and her friend showed up. i was
      happy and content. even moreso when the englishman and my angel arrived back.
      we were all together again, one drunk family.<br /><br />friday was stranger.
      the englishman, angel and i were headed down to the pill in allston. we met
      at my old local down there, had a beer, then headed out for the pill. when we
      arrived it was the usual deadness, but it soon filled up. about a month back
      i had met this chick at an afterparty for the pill at the irish talker's apartment.
      we made out in his kitchen for about a half hour, then split. i bumped into
      her there this night. she said 'didn't we make out at one point in some kitchen?'
      oh yeah. for what would seem like the last song, i pulled her by the hand away
      from her friends, and it didn't take long before we were making out on the dancefloor.
      i'm a piece of work when i'm lit. there was a tap on my shoulder, and i turn
      around, but nothing. i knew that the ex might show up, so i wanted to find out
      if that was her. i ran after asking my friends if she was here. they confirmed
      and i went to find her. she thought it funny, the circumstance in which we met
      up, well, funny considering the way things were between us, but things were
      cool. i promised the kitchen makeout that i'd be back, but i didn't think i
      would. i left alone with the ex, she had a car, and we ended up at the englishman's
      balcony for one more beer. it was nice. then the ex drove me home, back to where
      we used to live together, but now only myself. we made out for a little while,
      i tried to get her in, but she said no. she has a boyfriend, afterall.<br /><br
      />saturday afternoon the artist and i had plans to go to the beach, but of course,
      as our demented space cadet road trips go, we never made it. we ended up at
      a flea market in lynn lynn the city of sin, outside the building 19 there. there
      was so much junk. it really reminded me of rembrandtsplein in amsterdam. i almost
      bought a video camera, but the guy wanted 50 for it, and it had no battery.
      i'm smarter than that. that night we all met up at the local for my new roomate's
      neighborhood warming party. we started at the bbq place, downstairs, another
      favourite of our's. this tall attractive brunette was sitting behind me, and
      she bumped her back into me. she said, 'i'm just going to lean up against you,
      if you don't mind. i didn't mind at all. we leaned backs on each other for a
      few minutes, then she started chiding me for drinking cheap beer. i was half
      the mind to tell her to fuck off, but instead i got what she was drinking, some
      vermont ipa. before she left, we exchanged numbers, and i said i'd call her.
      she said she'd really like that a lot. oh boy was i on that night. we made it
      back to the local, just us friends, and really tore it up good. on sunday afternoon
      i headed downtown with the artist. we went to chinatown, all the little shops
      and dollar stores. we got baubal tea, and some strange things, like 'the unique
      company' which was essentially a front for a little room where you could gamble
      and smoke. i really fell in love with chinatown with her. i was thinking about
      this brunette though. she was something else. really forward. that evening we
      met up at the local with the englishman, and indian and the angel and some of
      her friends. i thought i'd step outside and give the brunette a call. we made
      plans for that week, and she sure sounded excited. here's where things turn
      as they always do though. she sent me a text message not 20 minutes later saying
      that she was surprised or confused that i had called. she said she had too much
      to do before she left for france in a few weeks. well what the fuck, honey?
      maybe don't pick up guys before you go! i was surprised and confused that she
      did that, AND made a date with me too! some women are horrible horrible people.
      bathing in the molted rejection i drank myself stupid. i was a real mess. becky
      called me to make things worse. she yelled at me for being drunk. but she was
      drunk too! i was so gone i don't remember how it turned out. i remember getting
      home, booting in the toilet, and then missing the first couple hours of work
      on monday. thank god my boss knows this life as much as i do.

    - detonatation I
    - a cool release, a letting go. the rain which spattered down on me in seaford
      that night, the 13th of may 2007. walking with unmade albums screaming through
      my head. such love in my heart, but i do not know for who. the burning, seething
      heart that tries to reach out. from where i found it they don't believe me.
      i try to tell them that this is not the life we should be living. i try to get
      them to understand what i mean when i say that i want to be dead. it is dead
      to what they know. regardless, mortality is not the issue. it's leaving them
      forever. that is not a bad thing.

    - the evening had the makings to be debaucherous from the start, and my heart
      began aching early on in anticipation of the sorrow, the mourning, and the regret
      that daylight would bring the next day. a half-crafted out pub crawl for an
      angel's birthday was the backdrop. she had cut her hair that day, from long
      to very short. her hidden wings, her heart and her inhibitions were sadly hidden,
      but still present. friends and half hearted companions around we started from
      bar to bar. by the 3rd stop which was an awful upscale and plastic place called
      grafton st., she walked in, friends with the honouree. i had met her once briefly
      before and she had made just an impression then. she was strange, a cliche free
      spirit. she was leaving for asia at the end of august just because. she talked
      about going back to south america or mexico as well. i wanted to have her. we
      were ready to go, but she had a full beer. without hesitation the beer, a full
      pint in a glass, was in her handbag, precariously propped up at the end, but
      hidden. after we left that awful place she would give all seven of us a ride.
      we walked to her car, and she realized before long that she had forgotten where
      she parked it, even though it had only been about 15 minutes since she did.
      we sat and smoked while she went to get her car, walking around harvard with
      a full pint in her purse. she finally drove up and the seven of us piled in.
      there was a cop parked across the street, but he was faced the other way. we
      ended up going to a 24 hour shop to get more cigarettes and rolling papers and
      try to use the bathroom. she parked in the lot, locked up and from the shop
      we went to another, even worse bar in porter square. there was 80s music being
      pumped through these little department store grade speakers in the ceiling.
      it was awful. we sat and talked, she drank the rest of the beer in her purse,
      and i drank a bloody mary. i don't know why, i really like them lately, plus
      i somehow feel cool drinking them. i'm probably just mental though. she told
      me all sorts of stories about getting ripped off in south america, and about
      how she was afraid she'd get ripped off in asia as well. i told her about my
      friend pete and his travels. he's been on almost every continent. the guy is
      a madman. we left that joint and walked back to her car. now there were 8 of
      us; the couple from minnesota, the bodybuilder, the map maker and her friend,
      the angel, her and myself. we arrived to find her car hitched to the back of
      a tow truck. she ran over to try and talk the guy out of it. she ended up paying
      the guy $75. that was rough, and i kinda felt bad. there was also another cop
      across the lot, so we decided not to tempt the fates, and instead piled in only
      6 people. the map maker and her friend were going to walk to the next place.
      this next place was our local. our beloved bar filled with it's beloved, drunken
      regulars. we tied a few more on, and i bought her a bloody mary along with mine.
      the bartender gave me the usual shit for ordering a morning drink. i pointed
      to the clock showing thirty past midnight and said that it was the morning.
      she was bugging out early as she had to drive to roslindale where she was staying.
      i asked to walk her to her car, and she said sure, that'd be fine. at her car
      i felt real smooth. i was drunk, and i was in the mood where i felt i could
      say anything and get away with it. usually that mood is rare, but when it happens,
      it's usually true. i said i wanted to kiss her, and asked her if i could. she
      said, sure, but only cause you asked. we made out for a few minutes there outside
      the bank, the same as i had done a few nights earlier with the english girl.
      god i missed the english girl so bad. i do now writing this too. it's probably
      the guilt, but it's also loneliness. i went back to the bar, and finished the
      night, happy with myself and happy with my friends who surrounded me. the night
      fizzled as the bar closed, and the angel and i decided to head down to a friend
      of ours' house. he was an irish bartender at our beloved and he lived with another
      irish guy. they both like to drink and fuck, and they did both a lot. we first
      walked back to the angel's house and walked in to the kitchen to get a 30 pack
      of beer. her mother came running out of the kitchen and was in no mood to be
      seen or talked to. i was too drunk to even be aware of what was going on. we
      got in the cab, and the guy started taking us for a ride. it was awful. $10
      for what we could have walked in 20 minutes. we walked in to their place to
      see them in the kitchen with these two girls that they had picked up that night.
      they were both pretty busted, on in particular. i don't know why i did, but
      kinda felt bad for her in a weird sort of way. i wanted to make it with her,
      but because i felt sorry for her. i knew i didn't want to go all the way, so
      i compromised i guess. this is where the night took an incredibly embarrassing
      turn. i asked if i could go down on her. i said, no strings attached, i don't
      need anything, i can take care of myself. she kept going on about how this was
      the weirdest night of her life, and she couldn't believe that i could just ask
      her something like that. i said i guess i could believe that i could do something
      like that because baby, i just did it. yeah, i was real smooth in my head. so
      we ended up going outside and making out for a bit. you know, it was actually
      kind of good. then she went to the bathroom and followed her in. i shut off
      the light, and made good on my promise. i felt like shit afterwards though.
      she passed out on the couch, and i told the angel i was leaving. i walked home
      around 430am and boy did it take forever. i made the mistake of depressing myself
      and called becky in the off chance she was up. i left a deranged message about
      how i wanted her to come home to me, that i miss her, that i want her back,
      that i want her forever. i'm a mental case most of the time. the next morning,
      i lay in bed nursing my hangover. i was absolutely depressed in a real bad way.
      i missed her so much. i felt like pieces of my heart had been ripped out. the
      worst part is that i ripped those pieces out myself.

    - i met the kiwi through an english friend of mine. she was thin, attractive and
      had a great personality. we agreed to get together before she left for san francisco
      at the end of the next month. we sat down to dinner, my stomach tightened from
      the bad flaxseed oil i had downed before leaving the house. we were eating indian,
      and almost immediately started talking about our mental defects. for a first
      date, this was going great in my mind. i could tell her everything it seemed.
      i was careful not to gush though. i was being pretty cool. she said she had
      issues sleeping around to much. she said she was a sex addict. i told her i
      had dysthymia, and that i wouldn't do drugs for it. she told me how she is a
      psychiatrist, but doesn't practice. we hopped across the street to meet her
      friends and boy am i glad we did. there were 3 or 4 of them, i don't really
      know, because there was only 1 that i was paying attention to. she had lived
      in england for 10 years, and it turned out that we knew a lot of the same people
      from this club that i used to go to pretty regularly on friday nights called
      the pill. we talked a lot that evening, and my date didn't seem to mind. she
      knew that she was leaving, and neither of us were really investing much in each
      other. during the evening the english girl got me outside for a smoke by ourselves.
      she said that she didn't know what my deal was, but that she liked me and wanted
      to get together at a later date. we exchanged numbers and then it became clear
      that we had it for each other. later in the evening we got sick of where we
      were and the whole operation climbed into a car and headed up to my beloved
      regular. the english girl and i were in back of the car together while my date
      was in the passenger seat. the english girl was holding my hand and i hers and
      everything for that moment was alright in the world to me. that three minute
      car ride was all i needed. i asked my english friend if the english girl was
      some sort of player. it was in his mind that she was, but i didn't want to believe
      it. maybe it was the booze, but i ended up just flat out asking her if she was.
      she said she wasn't, but i was skeptical. she reminded me a lot of jane. she
      was 24, had lived in england, was a bona fide anglophile, liked all the same
      music, and was svelt and lovely. i was skeptical with her alright. my date and
      her other friends ended up bagging out around 1 in the morning, and the bar
      was closing anyway. it was just me and the english girl and i was on cloud nine.
      we walked hand in hand up the street to get some loot so i could get her a cab
      home safe. i told her i didn't want her to stay over because she had real potential
      to be something really good in my life. she liked that. we made out for a few
      minutes outside the bank. we were professionals, and i was real smooth with
      her. after i got her in a cab i walked home with this ridiculous grin on my
      face. the next day at work i was still wearing it. that girl is going to break
      my heart. i can already feel it.

    - this pain i know all too well, this pain from mary ellen, leah, jessie, and
      now becky is all too familiar. it is the sting of loss. the memories that you
      took for granted back when you were together. it's the loneliness. it's the
      feeling that life is going to be a little worse, and your next relationship
      will be a little worse as well. it's the feeling of deep unhappiness. crying
      doesn't help, nor does getting drunk, nor does sleeping around. the fact that
      becky felt so horrible like this for months while i was wasting my time with
      jane hurts that much more. i was a fool. i want becky back in the worst way,
      and i can't have that. there's nothing i can do, and everything besides myself
      is out of my control. this too will pass. it can't pass soon enough. my dear
      sweet becky, love of my life, all that i want. you too will pass.

    - several hours after nann woke up she felt horrible that she was only now becoming
      lucid. her mind rushed from the back of her head on the floor to the very tip
      of her face, bursting through her dried out eyelids. her eyes struggled to see
      past the unfortunate buildup of unconsciousness that had collected that night
      and morning. finally her awareness had broken two holes through her eyelids
      and a burst of bright light that shown through the window quickly adjusted her
      irises to reality that began input to her confused brain a mere second ago.
      a cheap imitation soda bottle was the first thing she noticed, hovering above
      her pallid face threatening to fall down on her nose. it was alighted atop an
      old scratched and faded dresser. the collection of drawers had mismatched handles.
      she noticed with a start that she couldn't move right away; her arms and legs
      frozen in the stiffness and rigor mortis that had managed to accumulate over
      the last eleven hours that she lay there, still, silent, and not conscious.
      she struggled to move, understanding why she couldn't yet still very worried.
      a finger first twitched, then a toe. following the 5 degree rotation of her
      right leg, she now had command of most of her right arm as well. slowly, and
      creakily as if a tree were coming to life, parts of her snapped back into life,
      with angular twitching. several minutes had passed, and she had control over
      her body again, but still had a long way to go as every movement felt like a
      pile of bricks were in order to be moved. and to make things worse, her delerium
      wasn't helping. she knew that before she could move a muscle, permission had
      to be granted, and a white basket of bricks hauled up to a higher shelf in relation
      to her current position. each movement would then send signals through her underground
      dwelling that great subterrainian tectonic plates would need to be flipped for
      her tiny neighbors to be alright. cables lined the walls from her shoulders
      to the edge of the underground cavern where she lay. the cieling a splendor
      of coke bottle bottoms, peering down through her to the floor like a thousand
      circles each with an eye. permission had been granted, the bricks moved higher,
      and a square mile of underground flooring had been flipped as planned. nann
      rolled over onto a pile of t-shirts that had lay sympathetically as still next
      to her throughout the night. a wave of colourful pixels flooded her eyes, and
      her forehead became warm, yet strangely comfortable as well. she forced a clear
      thought of sleep, and wondered why it was so light out. it was now that she
      became aware of the sweat that had collected in the small of her back. dishes
      rattled in the next room, and she groaned, raising a knee in cold, sweaty altitude.

      for instance why do mutual crushes always seem to turn bad yet the girl never

      no big deal it just sucks because I'm left still feeling that crush, but they

    - taking care not to care
    - a constant for me has always been to better myself in order to spite exes. it
      gives me great joy that with the exception of a few girls in boston, i would
      be barely recognisable to my exes. they would not recognise my lifestyle, my
      music, my clothes, only possibly my glasses, but that's a stretch. i am constantly
      trying to better myself in the face, (or lack,) of my discerning exes. the looks
      of dissapointment, the drudging realisation of "how much wasted time?" the self
      loathing for having been with me, which slowly turns into a false sense of feminism
      for them. i become a target of masculinity, (yeah, i know) an easy prey, given
      that the relationship was riddled with self-importance based on not being alone.
      in my emotionally crippled state, in my heartbroken jungle of freshly exposed
      co-dependance, fleeting hopes and mind boggling puzzles and brainteasers of
      where or on who to place the blame, an easy prey i become. but as i grow over
      the years, growing to resent, the time i spent with her, the time and money
      and fuel i put into the relationship (and my car, as a by-product of the relationship)
      as i try to forget a little more each day, i still find myself drawn to revealing
      myself to them - but! i wouldn't want a conversation, or even a face to face
      meeting. i just want them to know that i am now better than them. i moderately
      care how much i want them to know that i don't care. i can let go of the past,
      but it's hard to let go of the people.

      to stay with me. she came back in becky, but now i hope that it was her spirit
      that fulfills me, and not a burden that haunts me. i would call jessie, but
      i don't know how she'd react. it would cause a rift,if it is a spirit that is
      with me. becky might not know how to react...doppelganger, an addition. spring
      '99 is when this video comes from. these were times before september eleventh.
      i'm only 28, but i can still say they were a simpler, more innocent time. also
      before i moved to the city. things are so much more complicated now. i was hairy,
      in college, and about 30 pounds heavier. i was angry a lot, though too. becky
      has taught me to laugh. i told her that. laugh from the heart. \n<br />\n<br
      />jessie and i drove so much during college. we were always on the road. new
      hampshire and vermont are so lush and green. the grey road with the bright yellow
      lines, the big fluffy clouds and the steel rails running along side our never-ending
      journey. jessie sounds different on this tape than i remember her. \n<br />\n<br
      />a puppy, dakota, runs around my best friend gilbert's yard, fat and bloated
      with heart worms. she was cured. she was eve and evan's puppy. eve's mother
      usedto paint her nails. they're selling that house - the house i grew up in.
      i had my first kiss in that house. it was with eve. she was 10 and i was 12.
      a peck on the lips. i insisted that it shouldn't be through toilet paper. evan's
      in the marines on inactive duty after serving - an avid bush fan if i remember.
      \n<br />\n<br />my first girlfriend, leah, is also on this tape. it was the
      day her and her family were leaving for maine. sitting around her sister's backyard,
      eating chips and smoking marlboro 100s, soon to leave for a worldof sweatshirts
      with moose and wolves on them. it cuts to a scene of me and jessie. i'm making
      her do silly things on the camera and giving her a flower, and telling her she's
      cute, and thati love her.\n<br />\n<br />the part where i filmed their backyard-
      her dad told me notto film the place where they grow the weed. i didn't cause
      it never happened. jessie came outto make sure i wasn't. or at least i think
      that's why she came out. i sang 'jessie's girl' to her in the car. one day i'll
      wake up driving around connecticut in the red neon and i'll get to screw it
      all up again. "

    - i'm too loud for my downstairs neighbors
    - |-
      yeah, i got the note this morning that specifically called more than 3 occasions where i had been too loud as a neighbor, including the loud sex which was so eloquently referred to as "entertaining guests". i felt bad, i felt horrible. the people who proceeded them once interrupted a night of my "entertaining guests" with a fist fight in which i had threaten the police as a somber dickhead carried a smashed wooden chair out the front door to the garbage. i was too loud for the down stairs neighbors. so they didn't appreciate kraftwerk. i felt like an ass until i read the explanation that they work in advertising, so they work odd hours. advertising, huh? hmmm...yeah, they work in <b>advertising</b>. it must be so annoying to have to live with unexplained, and un-asked for interruptions, isn't it? it must be tough to live with annoyances like being bombarded by something obtrusive that you didn't ask for. what a pain in the ass to have to deal with pop-ups like your loud neighbors "entertaining" their girlfriends at undisclosed hours of the night. sure, my forgotten alarm clock was a pain in the ass, for an hour at a time, on some saturday morning when i wasn't around. advertising takes up a quarter of every hour of TV that i barely watch. ok, ok....i'm being unfair. maybe they advertise for non-profits, maybe they are the 'good guys'. perhaps i should find out what kind of advertising they're in before blasting the organization as a whole, you know, do a little market research first. lumping together occupations, or people is as bad as say...demographics? oops! i did it again. i shouldn't generalize. they extended the olive branch and i should comply. i've got my ice-breaker all planned out - "so what's more annoying? my noise, or commercials?"
      <br />
      <br />i thought all this out on my way to the swillo to meet rob who was high on shrooms as it turns out. at first arrival, after getting a PBR, i headed to the bathroom which had a distinct barn smell. yet, peaceful as it was, i could still hear the bar(n) noise through the slatted swillo door. but peace WAS to be found in the piece of plumbing that looked a lot like a ying-yang. rob went on about hipsters, renee (his new girl) and music. i learned that i have to read some Nietzsche, and so i will. after seeing i heart huckabees i have to get some german existentialism. too much french on the brain.

      <br />
      <br />i hope i'm not typing too loud.

      how did i let myself get to here? i go through life now essentially feeling nothing again. why am i not manic anymore? because i'm not anything emotional anymore. i can't write music, write anything interesting, nor feel anything one way or the other. i guess i have to get out of this, but i really don't have the motivation to do so. it's kind of nice not having anything bother me, but it's also nice having things matter.

      it's one of those moments where my brain folds in on itself, and i hit a block. i told becky that she'd be better off with her friend of many years jarred. i see it, not just because of my own low self-esteem telling me that i don't deserve someone, but because i see the way she acts around him. she's a lot freer, and a lot happier. of course i'd say that. but now to explain that? how does someone explain these things to their girlfriend? it's like explaining the inherant problems with a republican government to a complete reactionary. i just know things sometimes, and i need to be trusted over them. but when those things alter lifestyles, and relationships, maybe i should just ignore them. maybe everybody else gets things like this, but they're smart enough to keep quiet about it.
