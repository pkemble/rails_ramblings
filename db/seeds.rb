I want that piece to be mine!\" but defiant mom asks, \"so I can't have this?\" mom knows there's another piece that madeline most likely won't even get all the way through. \"no no no!\" madeline protests further as mom gives in and gives the burnt toast to madeline. madeline then wants mom to eat the part that was dipped in the soup, which mom does. madeline then eats the toast, clearly not enjoying it, but she defiantly continues, despite the charred taste. like mother like daughter.")
