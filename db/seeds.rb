  {title: "", body: "Fucking weird. Here I hope will follow a documentation of some of the weird things that have been happenning to me in this cold town in the past 7 days. Last Wednesday I went out to Our House with Nora and her roommate ricardo. He was cool, and is interested in being in my riot boy band. I think the idea might work out. So this chick approaches us, and asks for a cigarette. She’s tanya, and she’s out o work, and all upset that she has $17 dollars left to her name. So I sympathise having been in the same situation, and give her 2. since she’s bitter, frustrated and kind of punk looking, I offer her to sing some stuff that I would write for her. She doesn’t sing, but leaves me a number anyway, and an e-mail address. Later on, I’m coming back from the bathroom, and she invites me over to her table where she’s with a friend, amanda. Amanda’s frigin’ hot, but has a boyfriend, so that’s that, however tanya giving me signals, and I say what the hell. So it turns out she’s only 20, but her fake id says she’s 29. good enough. We decide to go to the rest of mod night at the common ground around midnight. The bouncers don’t buy her fake id, so we have to go to the kells, the allston meatmarket, where they get hit on extensively by just about every sad, pathetic dateless jock there. I’m ready to go, because this tanya chick is provoking all of it, but she insists that I stay. I guess I probably shouldn’t have, since this weirdness has gone on long enough, and well, this just can’t turn out to be good a few weeks down the road. We end up back at tanya and amanda’s place, and amanda decided to go to bed. Well, one thing leads to another, and tanya and I end up sleeping together. I get home at 6:30, bright and early with only an hour and a half of sleep under my belt. Work sucked that day. That afternoon I call her, and she comes back over.we have sex again. This is looking odd, and we agree to be friends with benefits, because I’m just newly digging this single thing. Yes, for once, things are looking up. So Thursday night Amy, Collins, rob, jenny, and I go to harper’s ferry to see lovewhip, something I’ve been meaning to do for a while. Well, I’m fucking tired as shit, and dancing doesn’t seem to be helping, but lovewhip is like ska, so what the hell? 1.5 hours of sleep, dancing, and here comes the beers! By 12:30 or so, buck dewey comes on, and only amy and I are left. We decide to go over to the common ground for 80’s love night. When we get there, we are greeted by eighties rockers with arm band, leather, leather, and attitude! It’s rough there that night, but amy and I are tired as shit, and still wanna have fun, so we dance it up, with more and more beer. By the time the mosh pit comes around, we decide enough! It’s 1:45 or so, and I’m pooped. I slept well. Friday night rolls around, and after some much enjoyable $6.75 pitchers of micheloeb at the sillhouette lounge with my sister and brother-in-law, I end up meeting up with tanya at her friend chris’ house. They’re all so friekin’ hip, and trendy it hurts. They’re all sitting around thinking it’s funny as shit that as trendy and art school as they are, they still love christine aguilera and britney spears. “can you believe it? Oh my god!” pl-fucking-ease! So tanya and I leave, and get back to my house for inevitable. she goes to the bathroom, and pees, THEN tells me I’m out of toilet paper, and there’s none under the sink. Shit! It’s raining, I’m drunk again, and store 24 Is open down the end of the block. So I run down there to get some more TP, calling people to tell then how I should have gotten her to use a fucking coffee filter, and be done with it. Well, score some TP, and we’re in business. After she gets back home Saturday morning, I went to natick for greg’s rainy barbecue. I meet this chick named MC and she gets all flirty for about 5 minutes, and gets me to talk about going down on girls for a few minutes, before turning totally off again. Fucking girls. What is it? Provocation, then depletion of interest. Fuck it. Then around 10 I head over to a house party on farrington in allston. It’s emily’s graduation party, and I met a bunch of really cool people there. At one point my friend jeremy say, “hey pete, when you’re done down here, come upstairs. There’s another party up there.” Oh yeah! So I go upstairs a few minutes later, and there’s jeremy with two chicks, valerie and allison. Valerie thinks she’s betty fucking page, and allison is completely wasted on oxy-contin. Allison says, “are you staying around, ‘cause the coke will be here soon.” What!? Jesus christ. I turn it down flat, and she says she’ll have sex with me if I do some coke with her. I still turn her down, and she says that she wants to meet someone to have a life, and babies with. I turn her down laughing, and she starts to try to get all serious with me, she gets real close, and says, “what will it take to get you to get high with me, while she starts kind of going for my crotch. Alright, I know I’m kind of an idiot, but please, I’m not that desparate. I turn her down again, and she starts to leave saying she wants to find someone to have life, sex, coke and babies with. Jesus I was laughing so hard. Later on I saw her all over every other guy in the party, asking them the same thing. Apparantly, (jeremy told me earlier) that she thought that she had sex with me before, and that she was convinced that I was a filmographer, but she just couldn’t remember when she had sex with me. Nice girl. Must be like a hot-dog in a bucket. the rest of the night, valerie is making eyes at me, but as soon as I saw the digital camera pictures of her blowing coke, I though, hmmm….nah. so the night ended with me on the porch, smiths on the radio, and a really cool bunch of people hanging out. Sunday was weird too. It was father’s day, and my father came down to visit us, and spent the day with us. At one point I came back home to find 16 bottles of liquor, some unopened, sitting ontop of the trash, along with about $40 worth of unopened food in a plastic bag. I was psyched! The lesbians in number 8 were moving out, and didn’t want to pack all of it, so they said, sure go ahead and take it. Yeah! Fully stocked wet bar in allston, ma.! The story continues on Tuesday night when I had nora, ricardo, collins, amanda and tanya over, and they sampled some of my sweet sweet alcohol collection. We all got trashed, had a great time, and after they all left, tanya stayed, and oh boy, bring on the dirt! She was well-nigh drunk, and I was pretty gone, so we end up screwing, after I begged for condoms from jenny. So I pull out afterwards, and crap!!!!!! No condom. Shit. I tell her to go into the bathroom, fish it out, and get in the bathtub, and wash it out. Wash all that shit out. She starts freaking out, screaming, oh crap, oh crap, I can’t get pregnant! I’m only 20! While I’m going jesus fucking hell, woman get a grip! She’s in the shower, and I’m like, wash it out! She says no, you do it. Oh fer cryin’ out crap! So I’m in the shower, digging with my fingers in her for god knows what, trying to keep my cool, drunk, worried, and alone in my apartment with this newly found-out psycho. She starts trying to make out with me while I’m fishing out the left over penis product, and goddam! I’m trying to do my job here! So later we decide to go to planned parenthood early next morning. Now I’m trying to get some sleep – it’s 3:40 in the morning, and I have to be up at 7, get to pp, then to work by 8:30. shit, now she’s all, oh my god, I’m going to be pregnant, then you have to marry me, and live with me forever! Fucking shit! How the fuck do I end up like this! I know how – I’m a fucking moron. That’s how. at this point, i'm thinking that maybe i should have treated jessie a little better. So then she starts with, do you like me? I like you a lot, and I like you more everyday. Jesus, like I need this shit now! I need fucking sleep, so I can get this chick the morning after pill, get to work, present to sales, and do my job. Well, she finally falls asleep, after this whole, ‘our first fight crap’ and the next morning, I take her to pp, (the goddam jesus – anti – abortion fuckers were there,) and she won’t get an appointment until 10. anyway, I go to work, (on the way out the jesus fuckers tried to get me to rethink tanya’s eminent abortion. I looked right one of them, and said, “get the fuck away from me, asshole!”) I’m freaking out, and later that day it turns out she’s alright. Now how the hell am I going to get out of this? I prolly won’t see her till Friday, so I’m good till then. Man, what a goddam week it’s been.", user_id: 1, tag_list: nil},

  {title: "", body: "i was walking between convenience stores this morning in search of non-latex condoms at the demand of a girl minutes prior when i started deciding what the opening lines of this entry would be. the circus started on friday night when the englishman, his girl and i went to allston to the britpop night. i started getting into it with the weasel's friend whom i am also friendly with, about how he stole the archaeologist from  me and how my bitterness was justified. he played it off as nothing, and this filled me with some minor rage. i needed to head out for a cigarette to diffuse the conversation, so i put my beer down next to a rather attractive girl, and asked if she could watch that for me. she gave me a face, and said that she'd do her best. i detected sarcasm. outside i cooled off, did some cbt and i was ok for the most part. who needed that whore, anyway? he did me a favour. they'll end soon enough anyway. on my way back in i picked up my beer, and started joking around with the girl, the way that becky and i uesd to. it was really nice. that day i had written becky off, and almost immediately it seemed her sense of humour was being replaced. i was floored by her personality. it seemed so right on at that moment. i could let myself go which was nice. i asked how old she was expecting the usual 23-25 year old shit. she said guess. i thought i'd at least compliment her and i said 21-22? then she said a beautiful thing, \"twenty-nine\". the words rolled out washing me over with hope, hope that there was hope and hope that though she may not be it, there is someone out there that is not 24 or 25. i told her to tell me again as if i didn't hear....\"t w e n t y   n i n e . . .\" she said. i was elated. we spent the remainder of the evening talking, joking dancing. man, she was sweet. i tried to teach her how not to dance like a hippy or a lesbian, the two dances she had mastered apparently. she is from seatlle. she bought me a drink without hesitation. she made fun of me. i was glad to come out. the englishman and his girl were getting in a fight, and he was on his way out with her. i said i'd stay. at the end of the night i shared a cab with the hippy and her friend. we dropped her friend off near harvard. i asked to use her can, but she didn't want to wake her kid up. wow. people my own age. it was a novelty. the hippy and i made it back to central square, and we had to pee pretty badly. we ducked behind a bar called the field and peed behind a dumpster and a car. it was the same alley where once becky and i had fooled around. and it wasn't alleyway fooling around, it was bedroom fooling around. the hippy and i were walking out of the alleyway, almost to the road. it was 3am. everything was shut, and the streets pretty empty. now or never i thought. i grabbed and planted one on her. she loved it. we made out for a while. i walked her back to her bike on mass ave. we made out a while more. she told me it was a boy's bike that she was riding. i said, 'oh yeah?' as she rode away. she turned over her shoulder and said 'yeah, it was my ex-husband's' and she rode off down a side street. i took a cab back home wondering what the hell had just happened. <br /><br />the following morning i got a message that she wanted to meet up for coffee. i agreed, and headed down to davis to meet her. i saw her walking down the street and followed to catch up. by the time i caught up to her, i had forgotten her name, and didn't want to tap her on the shoulder. she walked into another store, so i tapped, hoping for the best. she was startled, and then we both looked up at the sign above the door. it was planned parenthood. we laughed, she said she needed to get an abortion, and she'd be out in 5. i went to the bank, and said i'd meet her. we spent the afternoon together, we walked to porter to ride the escalator. we went to harvard and i got some camping supplies. we went to shays and sat outside drinking beers and talking. her mother had committed suicide that winter. she had been married for 6 months after 8 years of being together. he left her, and headed back to seattle. her sister has breast implants. we walked back to her's and made love on her bed. she had lots of strange tattoos. she has a dog and two cats. worn out, i went home, called up some friends to make plans for the evening. i started getting really depressed. i went to meet my brother at the bar where the hippy and i peed the night before. i went up to the local to meet up with the englishman. he was talking to a girl, and introduced me. she had a wonderful laugh. she was a socialist. we all got drunk together, and my roomate was there too. we headed back to our place after the bar closed, and brought the socialist and her roomate, the collector along for the ride as well. we had some booze i think. we sat and drank and played music. the socialist was on fire. three guys, and she knew she was the center of attention, and boy oh boy did she act on it. i hate that shit. after sometime, she decided to take her shirt off. she was sucking up all the attention. i swear i really hate that shit. later my roomate, visibly frustrated, went to bed. i felt bad. the socialist's roomate headed out as well. the socialist and i fooled around until the sun came up. she was demanding. my jaw hurt. i half slept, and woke up sweating. it was hot. she was lovely. petite, soft. i didn't feel guilty at all. i didn't care anymore. i was aware that i was giving up. nothing mattered. it was horrible. she woke up and i offered breakfast. i headed out to get it, and came back with it. she ate messily, and left half of it on my nightstand. she kept going on about the revolution. she kept calling mundane things \"counter-revolutionary\".  i told her socialism was dumb. all politics are dumb. you replace one system that fails on fulfilling everyone's values for another that fails on fulfilling everyone's stomachs. she started to fool around with herself, but said she needed a nap. i went out to the living room and 5 minutes later she came out to say that i needed to go get a certain brand of condom, because she needed to get fucked. i was indifferent. i didn't care. my head was somewhere else, and my heart, no more. i said, sure, and went out to find these condoms. i never found them i came back and blamed it on capitalism. i threw my european passport on her stomach. we fooled around a little more, exchanged numbers, and she went home. i just don't care about it anymore.", user_id:

maybe don't pick up guys before you go! i was surprised and confused that she did that, AND made a date with me too! some women are horrible horrible people. bathing in the molted rejection i drank myself stupid. i was a real mess. becky called me to make things worse. she yelled at me for being drunk. but she was drunk too! i was so gone i don't remember how it turned out. i remember getting home, booting in the toilet, and then missing the first couple hours of work on monday. thank god my boss knows this life as much as i do.", user_id: 1, tag_list: nil},

  {title: "", body: "the evening had the makings to be debaucherous from the start, and my heart began aching early on in anticipation of the sorrow, the mourning, and the regret that daylight would bring the next day. a half-crafted out pub crawl for an angel's birthday was the backdrop. she had cut her hair that day, from long to very short. her hidden wings, her heart and her inhibitions were sadly hidden, but still present. friends and half hearted companions around we started from bar to bar. by the 3rd stop which was an awful upscale and plastic place called grafton st., she walked in, friends with the honouree. i had met her once briefly before and she had made just an impression then. she was strange, a cliche free spirit. she was leaving for asia at the end of august just because. she talked about going back to south america or mexico as well. i wanted to have her. we were ready to go, but she had a full beer. without hesitation the beer, a full pint in a glass, was in her handbag, precariously propped up at the end, but hidden. after we left that awful place she would give all seven of us a ride. we walked to her car, and she realized before long that she had forgotten where she parked it, even though it had only been about 15 minutes since she did. we sat and smoked while she went to get her car, walking around harvard with a full pint in her purse. she finally drove up and the seven of us piled in. there was a cop parked across the street, but he was faced the other way. we ended up going to a 24 hour shop to get more cigarettes and rolling papers and try to use the bathroom. she parked in the lot, locked up and from the shop we went to another, even worse bar in porter square. there was 80s music being pumped through these little department store grade speakers in the ceiling. it was awful. we sat and talked, she drank the rest of the beer in her purse, and i drank a bloody mary. i don't know why, i really like them lately, plus i somehow feel cool drinking them. i'm probably just mental though. she told me all sorts of stories about getting ripped off in south america, and about how she was afraid she'd get ripped off in asia as well. i told her about my friend pete and his travels. he's been on almost every continent. the guy is a madman. we left that joint and walked back to her car. now there were 8 of us; the couple from minnesota, the bodybuilder, the map maker and her friend, the angel, her and myself. we arrived to find her car hitched to the back of a tow truck. she ran over to try and talk the guy out of it. she ended up paying the guy $75. that was rough, and i kinda felt bad. there was also another cop across the lot, so we decided not to tempt the fates, and instead piled in only 6 people. the map maker and her friend were going to walk to the next place. this next place was our local. our beloved bar filled with it's beloved, drunken regulars. we tied a few more on, and i bought her a bloody mary along with mine. the bartender gave me the usual shit for ordering a morning drink. i pointed to the clock showing thirty past midnight and said that it was the morning. she was bugging out early as she had to drive to roslindale where she was staying. i asked to walk her to her car, and she said sure, that'd be fine. at her car i felt real smooth. i was drunk, and i was in the mood where i felt i could say anything and get away with it. usually that mood is rare, but when it happens, it's usually true. i said i wanted to kiss her, and asked her if i could. she said, sure, but only cause you asked. we made out for a few minutes there outside the bank, the same as i had done a few nights earlier with the english girl. god i missed the english girl so bad. i do now writing this too. it's probably the guilt, but it's also loneliness. i went back to the bar, and finished the night, happy with myself and happy with my friends who surrounded me. the night fizzled as the bar closed, and the angel and i decided to head down to a friend of ours' house. he was an irish bartender at our beloved and he lived with another irish guy. they both like to drink and fuck, and they did both a lot. we first walked back to the angel's house and walked in to the kitchen to get a 30 pack of beer. her mother came running out of the kitchen and was in no mood to be seen or talked to. i was too drunk to even be aware of what was going on. we got in the cab, and the guy started taking us for a ride. it was awful. $10 for what we could have walked in 20 minutes. we walked in to their place to see them in the kitchen with these two girls that they had picked up that night. they were both pretty busted, on in particular. i don't know why i did, but kinda felt bad for her in a weird sort of way. i wanted to make it with her, but because i felt sorry for her. i knew i didn't want to go all the way, so i compromised i guess. this is where the night took an incredibly embarrassing turn. i asked if i could go down on her. i said, no strings attached, i don't need anything, i can take care of myself. she kept going on about how this was the weirdest night of her life, and she couldn't believe that i could just ask her something like that. i said i guess i could believe that i could do something like that because baby, i just did it. yeah, i was real smooth in my head. so we ended up going outside and making out for a bit. you know, it was actually kind of good. then she went to the bathroom and followed her in. i shut off the light, and made good on my promise. i felt like shit afterwards though. she passed out on the couch, and i told the angel i was leaving. i walked home around 430am and boy did it take forever. i made the mistake of depressing myself and called becky in the off chance she was up. i left a deranged message about how i wanted her to come home to me, that i miss her, that i want her back, that i want her forever. i'm a mental case most of the time. the next morning, i lay in bed nursing my hangover. i was absolutely depressed in a real bad way. i missed her so much. i felt like pieces of my heart had been ripped out. the worst part is that i ripped those pieces out myself.", user_id: 1, tag_list: nil},
